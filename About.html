    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="IMG_2088.JPG" Class="selfie">
    <p>My name is Veronica Agyapong, and I'm an international student from Ghana, currently pursuing my sophomore year in computer science at Berea College. My journey to study in the USA has been filled with challenges and uncertainties, just like many of you might be experiencing right now.</p>

<p>This website was born out of my own experiences and the desire to assist students facing similar dilemmas. I created this platform to provide a comprehensive resource for international students looking to study in the USA. Through detailed college profiles, scholarship information, and inspiring student stories, I aim to simplify the college selection process and empower students to make informed decisions about their academic journey.</p>

<p>Studying abroad is a life-changing experience, and my goal is to make it more accessible and less daunting for students worldwide. I believe that knowledge is the key to success, and by sharing valuable information and personal insights, I hope to help students achieve their dreams of studying in the USA.</p>
